# Cutting Room

Cutting Room is a plugin for [Unity](https://unity.com) developed by [Digital Creativity Labs](https://digitalcreativity.ac.uk/) at the [University of York](https://york.ac.uk) which allows creators to build and deploy Object Based Media productions.

## Getting Started

* Ensure that you have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed.
* Clone the repository: `https://github.com/Digital-Creativity-Labs/CuttingRoom.git`
* Open the cloned project with <b>Unity (2020.3.23f1 or above)</b>.
* Open the first sample tutorial: `Assets/Samples/UnityVideo/1AtomicNarrativeObject/AtomicNarrativeObject.unity` to learn the basics.
* Complete the remaining tutorials: `Assets/Samples/UnityVideo`
* Build your own productions and share them with us via one of our [communities](https://github.com/Digital-Creativity-Labs/CuttingRoom#community).

## Documentation

API documentation can be found:

* Within the `Docs` directory of the repository.
* On [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zP1hT55O3PNzLHuhHe202givsCCV0Iat/view?usp=sharing).

## Samples

Samples are available within the Samples directory of the repository. These include samples using the Unity [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) component and also samples using the [AVProVideo](https://renderheads.com/products/avpro-video/) plugin (not included). 

The sample Unity scenes provide an interactive demo on how to set up a Cutting Room production and also explain the functionality available within the tool.
